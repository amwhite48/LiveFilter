## Overview
### Description
This app allows the user to apply a filter to the camera while taking a photo and then adjust that filter. The user can then save the filter they created for later use.


### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Photography, social
- **Mobile:** Allows user to adjust filters on a photo as they take a picture, as well as browse other filters and apply them as they use their phone camera. This app gives users the ability to edit and adjust their photos before they take them and save the filter they created to use later.
- **Story:** Users can adjust the appearance of their photos before they take them, and then save this adjustment to apply it again when they want a similar effect. Users can also browse new effects to try out on their photos. Gives user more power to design the effects they apply and the flexibility to try them out with the camera rather than editing effects like this afterwards.
- **Market:** Any users who take photos and want to customize them can use this app. 
- **Habit:** If a user wanted to take a photo with a particular effect they can't find elsewhere, they can design it and continue using it when they want. Users can adjust the camera as they like and also discover new filters to use.
- **Scope:** The first version of the app allows the users to apply preselected filters. The next iteration would allow them to design their filters in the app while they're using the camera. Another iteration allows sharing and saving these filters. A possible future iteration could include applying filters to photos from the camera roll.
